# SCEmbed
Program (currently CLI-only) to embed scripts in *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* save files. Tested on iOS and desktop.

All credit for the research into embedding scripts goes to OrionSR over at GTAForums. You can read more about his findings [over there](https://gtaforums.com/topic/932498-embedding-scripts-in-save-files/).

## Usage
You can use the tool as follows:
```
/path/to/binary <input save> <modded output save>
```

For example:
```shell
embed-linux-amd64 "~/Documents/GTA San Andreas User Files/GTASAsf1.b" "~/Documents/GTA San Andreas User Files/GTASAsf2.b"
```
