# SCEmbed
Program (currently CLI-only) to embed scripts in *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* save files. Tested on iOS and desktop.

All credit for the research into embedding scripts goes to OrionSR over at GTAForums. You can read more about his findings [over there](https://gtaforums.com/topic/932498-embedding-scripts-in-save-files/).
